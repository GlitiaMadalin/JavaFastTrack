==========================================================

The purpose: 
	is to pass technical interview 

We will:
	keep it simple, as much as we can.

We will: 
	only focus on some basics that will help you to pass technical interview 
	like static, basic algorithms, overriding, overloading, abstraction. 

Most of our time:
	we will try to solve questions with loops and arrays, and we will practice some OOP concepts.
